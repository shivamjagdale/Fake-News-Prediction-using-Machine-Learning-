# Fake-News-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-
Here we will see how we can use machine learning to know if a news is real or fake.

News is an important daily part of our life so we want to know if the news we are reading is correct or fake. 

Here we have dataset with data such as id, title, author, text, label etc
We will use that data to our advantage and with the help of labels train our model so that anytime we give it an input our model should predict whether the news is real or fake. 

Here we will follow the standard workflow :-
collection of the data, data-preprocessing, train and testing, then feeding this data to our trained model and see if it predicts correctly.
